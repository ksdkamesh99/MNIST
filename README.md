## üìå Introduction

This Machine Learning Web Application utilizes a Two-Layered Convolutional Neural Network to process the images in the notepad provided in the application.  

Our Model performs fairly well with an accuracy of 99.26%. This provides a handy tool to utilize the power of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Categorical Classification Problems where time and accuracy is the paramount objective of classification.


## üéØ About The Dataset  
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
